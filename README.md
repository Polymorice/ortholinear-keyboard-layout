I have gotten into the mechanical keyboard hobby during the pandemic. after going through a couple of keyboards with various setups. I realized two thing that would make a keyboard works better for me.

#### key features (pun intended)

#### few thoughts

- `space bar` is a huge waste of space, it can also be the cause of many issues like the hollow echo sound un modded `space bar` can produce.
- personally I prefer the use of key combinations, which vastly reduced the time in productivity, especially for tasks like programming, or on Linux and Mac, where terminal is utilized heavily. thus splitting the `space bar` into multiple functions is the key for this mod.
- I have chosen the ortholinear keyboard layout, due to its flexibility and its max key numbers amongst all keyboard layouts.
- I have previously gotten a keyboard from IDOBAO before, therefore I have chosen their ortholinear model [ID75](https://idobao.net/collections/keyboard-kit/products/idobao-id75v1-hot-swappable-mechanical-keyboard-kit?variant=39370046341251). I think previously the model was marketed as IDOBO ID75, but I think it's the same as IDOBAO ID75, except the firmware is still referred as [IDOBO](https://config.qmk.fm/#/idobo/LAYOUT_ortho_5x15)
- I made this layout based on some popular layouts, but tailored more to my own needs. some of the design decisions are made on convenience and ergonomics, therefore I think sharing this layout will benefit more.

#### personalized design

- personally I primarily use left thumb for `space bar`,
